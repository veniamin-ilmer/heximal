# Heximal

For a sneak peak, [here are what my hexmial number system looks like](heximal.jpg).

## Introduction

The output of mathematical formula can be considered as elegant and beautiful.

However, the mathematical notation used to describe the formula, is not elegant, and is rather arbitrary.

Frequently when mathematicians needed to invent some constant or function, they were not very creative.

For example if you look at the number *4*, there is no particular quality about that number that describes its quantity at all. In school, you just have to memorize that that's what a 4 looks like.

Similarly, check out *x*^*y* = *z*. If you want to solve for *x*, you end up with this: *y* = **ln**(*z*) / **ln**(*x*)

This is very inconsistent.. an equation which a superscript value gets solved by dividing two functions.

This inconsistency and arbitrariness causes confusion for students learning mathematics.

I intend to completely redefine all of mathematics to feel more intuitive and consistent.

Based on my findings from [here](https://github.com/veniamin-ilmer/better-standards/tree/master/base-6), base 6 is the most optimal base for humans to use.

I will be using that as a foundation to redefine all of mathematics from the ground up.
