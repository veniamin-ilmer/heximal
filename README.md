# New Math Notation

## Introduction

The output of mathematical formula can be considered as elegant and beautiful.

However, the mathematical notation used to describe the formula, is not elegant, and is rather arbitrary.

Frequently when mathematicians needed to invent some constant or function, they were not very creative.

For example if you look at the number *4*, there is no particular quality about that number that describes its quantity at all. In school, you just have to memorize that that's what a 4 looks like.

Similarly, check out *x*^*y* = *z*. If you want to solve for *x*, you end up with this: *y* = **ln**(*z*) / **ln**(*x*)

This is very inconsistent.. an equation which a superscript value gets solved by dividing two functions.

This inconsistency and arbitrariness causes confusion for students learning mathematics.

I intend to completely redefine all of mathematics to feel more intuitive and consistent.

Based on my findings from [here](https://github.com/veniamin-ilmer/better-standards/tree/master/base-6), base 6 is the most optimal base for humans to use.

I will be using that as a foundation to redefine all of mathematics from the ground up.

## Problems with current system

When choosing the most optimal base, there are two different factors at play:

1. The base should be small enough that it is easy to remember and reuse.
2. The base should be big enough that large numbers can be represented without much difficulty.

In decimal, we handle this by using digits 0 to 9, but loosly grouping numbers in 2 or 3 digits.

### Grouping

The number *12345* would typically be represented as *12,345*. The comma is added as a delimiter for readability, but is optional.

When reading the number out loud, it could be read in multiple different ways:

* One, Two, Three, Four, Five
* One, Twenty-Three, Forty-Five
* Twelve Thousand, Three Hundred, Forty-Five

I feel that the multiple representations of the same number causes misunderstandings.

I feel there should be one obvious way for numbers to be read.

The number "*100*" is looked at favorably as a "maximum" number, and hence we have a concept of a "percentage", where you can score an "*86%*" on a test, or get a coupon with a "*15%*" discount.

This is inconsistent from the grouping of 3 digits at a time. Why don't percentages have *1000%* as a maximum?

Finally, there is inconsistency about when to prepend an extra 0 to the front of a number.

When expressing time, why would you write it as *4:08*? Why don't you say that the time is *4:8*? Why don't you say that the time is *04:08*?

Same with dates. What date is this? *03-04-09*

What about *5/4/08*?

## Solution

My notation system fixes issues noted above, by using the relatively small base 6, but forces the user into grouping it into 2 digits all the time.

For a sneak peak, [here are what my heximal number system looks like](heximal.jpg).
